## Lab 03 - Getting to know Ike

### Objectives
The goal of this lab is to demonstrate three different concepts of containers in the Arquillian ecosystem:

* Embedded (such as Glassfish 3.1 from the [previous lab](https://github.com/ctpconsulting/chopen-workshop-arquillian/tree/master/lab02))
* Managed
* Remote

### Task

* Add additional maven profiles (could be done using [JBoss Forge Arquillian Plugin](https://github.com/forge/plugin-arquillian))
   * JBoss AS 7.0.2.Final Managed
   * JBoss AS 7.1.1.Final Remote (server already added to Eclipse in the VM, needs to be started before running the tests)
* Play around with the enviroment (i.e. run JBoss Remote in the debug mode and set few breakpoints)

Solution is available [here](https://github.com/ctpconsulting/chopen-workshop-arquillian/tree/master/lab03-solution).
